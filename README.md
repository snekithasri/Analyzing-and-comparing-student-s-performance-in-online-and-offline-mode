# Analyzing-and-comparing-student-s-performance-in-online-and-offline-mode

## Exam routine consists of arriving at your examination room, listening to someone discussing a subject you have no knowledge of, and finally taking your exam surrounded by 30 other nervous students. After the COVID-19 pandemic, this pattern has drastically changed, with classes being held online.Studying the effects of using the internet as a learning resource on students' performance is the focus of this project. The objective of this study was to evaluate and predict student performance in online mode and compare it to performance in offline mode to determine their learning potential.
